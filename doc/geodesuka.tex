\subsection{Directories}
In the main code directory exists several three letter folders, all being lower case since the Windows OS does not disinguish between files
that are lower case or upper case, for backwards compatibility reasons. In the main repository, there exists serveral subdirectories of the main
repository, for easy compiling and linking to other projects. In any repository created by Void Star Entertainment, the following directories will
be used.
\begin{lstlisting}
bin/
bld/
doc/
inc/
lib/
obj/
res/
src/
\end{lstlisting}
The bin/ directory is used for compiling binary executables. \\ \\
The bld/ directory stands for the Build Directory. The bld/ directory is used for platform specific builds of the repository.
In the case of the Geodesuka Engine, CMake has not been properly set up, and the engine only compiles out for Windows \& Linux Desktop operating systems. There are future plans
to incorporate mobile platforms, and MacOS, but currently the development of the engine is taking priority. \\ \\ The doc/ directory, this directory contains useful documentation
of the engine. Including this document which is a formated book of the engine. This document will be updated as regularly as the engine. \\ \\ The inc/ directory is your average repos include directory.
It contains all necessary public headers of the engine to link against the engine from any repository. Currently there is no support for dynamic library linking, the engine will be reporpused for dynamically
linked libary builds later.
